Hi curious reader ! <br/>
I am Akarsh. I was born in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. My name is derived from a hindi word which means '**Attraction**'. Fascinated with computers and its potiential to disrupt, connect and digitize large part of our life, I pursued a career as a software engineer. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I introspected and realized that through various position of responsibilities that I have held, I can transition into a more cross-functional profile. I decided to pursue an MBA, where I can gain necessary business & management skills. Also, increase my network with diverse peer group that a B-school offers. I am excited about this next part of my journey.
